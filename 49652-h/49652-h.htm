<p class="drop-cap">THERE was once a time when there
was no Christmas at all. There were
no beautiful Christmas trees and happy
songs and stockings filled with presents.
No one shouted “Merry Christmas!” or
“Christmas Gift!” No one told the sweet
story of Jesus, because Jesus had not come
into the world and so
there was no Christmas.
You see Christmas
is Jesus’ birthday,
and before he
came, of course people
could not keep
his birthday. You have heard of how wicked
and unhappy the people were long ago.
Although God loved them and tried to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
them do right, they forgot about him and did
so many naughty, disobedient things that
they were very miserable. Then God sent
a wonderful message to them. He told them
that some day he would send them his own
Son, who should be their King and teach
them how to do right. He said that his Son
would come as a little child to grow up
among them to love and help them. God
even told them what they should call this
baby who was to
be their King.
God said that
Christ would be
like a beautiful
light showing
them where to go.
It would be as
though some people
stumbling sorrowfully along a dark
street should suddenly see a bright light
shining ahead of them, making everything
cheerful and pleasant. They would be joyful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
like people who gather in the harvest.
Jesus makes his children happy, and he
wants them to shine out and make others
happy. These people who were so unhappy
before Jesus came, were very glad to know
that some day he would come. They talked
about him and waited a long, long time before
he came and brought Christmas light
into the world.</p>

<h2>The Coming of Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">LONG ago there lived a good man named
Joseph, a carpenter of Nazareth, who
built houses and made many useful things
for people. He also loved to read God’s
Gift Book, and tried to obey its rules. One
day the king of the land where Joseph lived
ordered everyone to write his name in a
book, and pay a tax, in his own city. So
Joseph and Mary his wife got ready to take
a long journey to their old home, Bethlehem.
There were no cars for them to ride in, so
they must either walk or ride a donkey. As
the fashion was there, Mary wore a long,
white veil which covered her beautiful face.</p>

<p>The streets were full of people, walking, or
traveling on mules, donkeys, or camels—all
going to be taxed. It was winter, but in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
warm country, and they went through valleys
of figs, olives, dates, oranges and other
good things.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 175px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="175" height="207" alt="on the way to Bethlehem" />
</div>

<p>They must have been very tired when
they reached Bethlehem’s gates, for they
had come a long distance,
and the dust of the road,
the bustle of traveling,
and the strangeness of it
all, seemed to add to their
trials. The people of
Bethlehem had opened
their homes and welcomed
the strangers, until every house was full,
and still the people kept coming. They
could scarcely go up the steep hill, they were
so weary, and Joseph tried to get a place to
rest, but there was no kind invitation, no
welcome in any house for them, and the inns
were crowded. The inns were not like our
hotels for travelers; they were flat-roofed
stone buildings, without windows. There
were no warm rooms with carpets, and soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
beds for tired travelers to lie on. There
were only bare floors, and everyone had to
bring his own bed and food. The courtyard
was full of animals—donkeys, mules, camels,
sheep and cows.</p>

<p>After Joseph had tried and failed to get
a resting place, as there was no room anywhere,
some kind friend told him of a cave
on the hillside which was used as a stable,
and to this they gladly went. Sweet-smelling
hay was all around, and the floor was
covered with straw; possibly mild-eyed cows
and gentle sheep were sleeping in their
stalls. Along the walls were mangers, or
boxes to hold the grain and hay when the
animals were fed. Here Mary and Joseph
found a shelter and a sleeping place; indeed,
they were thankful to be led there to rest
upon the hay. In the night a wonderful
thing took place: God sent the baby Gift
Child into the world. This gift had been
promised long before to Adam and Eve, and
now it had come—the most beautiful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dearest Baby ever held in a mother’s arms.
The night grew dark, the house-lights went
out one by one, and the people in Bethlehem
slept.</p>

<h2>The Angels’ Joy.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE happiest song that was ever sung
was sung on the first and best Christmas
of all. There was a time when there
was no Christmas. Can you think how
glad you would be if you had no Christmas,
and then one day all at once you had the
first and best one of all?</p>

<p>This song was sung and the first Christmas
came one night long years ago, far over
the sea, near a little town called Bethlehem.
It did not come first to kings and great people,
but to some shepherds who were sitting
up all night watching their sheep.</p>

<p>Outside of the city were beautiful sloping
green fields where the shepherds let their
sheep run about and eat the grass. The
weather there is very pleasant at Christmas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time; not at all like our weather. The
shepherds can sit out on the grass all night,
watching their sheep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 233px;">
<img src="images/illus18.jpg" width="233" height="149" alt="more angels more shepherds" />
</div>

<p>Did you ever see a sheep or a lamb? Do
you know that your mittens and jackets and
nice warm dresses are made of the wool
which the sheep have to spare for us? The
shepherds have to stay out with the sheep
all night because
they are very gentle
and timid
animals. They
cannot fight for
themselves, and if
they were left
alone the wolves would catch them.</p>

<p>One night about 1900 years ago some
shepherds were watching their sheep in
those fields. Very likely the shepherds were
some of the people who were hoping that
Jesus would soon come; perhaps they were
talking about him, and wondering how they
would know if he did come.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once a bright light shone about
them, and they saw an angel and heard him
speak to them. Very kind and beautiful
the angel looked, but the shepherds were
frightened.</p>

<p>The angel said to them, “Fear not; for
behold, I bring you good tidings of great
joy, which shall be to all people; for unto
you is born this day in the city of David a
Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And
this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find
the babe, wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying
in a manger.”</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 210px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="210" height="169" alt="heavenly host and angels" />
</div>

<p>As the angel was speaking, the shepherds
saw with him a great
number of beautiful,
shining angels. Then
was sung for the first
time this grand song,
for Christmas had
come. I do not know
the tune, but the very words are in the
Bible: “Glory to God in the highest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on earth peace, good-will toward men.”
Glory to God, for the greatest gift that
ever came; peace on earth, for all who love
this Savior.</p>

<p>As soon as the angels finished the song
they went back to heaven, and left the
shepherds alone.</p>

<h2>The Shepherds Visit Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHAT would you do if you had been
one of those shepherds to whom the
angels brought the good news of Jesus’ birth?
I will tell you what they did. They left their
sheep to take care of themselves, and hurried
off to Bethlehem, for that was the city
the angels meant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 224px;">
<img src="images/illus23.jpg" width="224" height="166" alt="same picture as before but a drawing instead of painting" />
</div>

<p>They went in the
gate and at last
found the right place.
It was called a stable.</p>

<p>They soon found
the dear little baby
Jesus, just as the angels had said, lying in
a manger, and Mary his mother and Joseph
taking care of him.</p>

<p>The little manger was in the stable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
there the shepherds stood beside it and
looked into the face of the babe.</p>

<p>Do you think the dear little baby had a
nice bed to lie in? It looked like a block
hollowed out. It was the box out of which
the cows ate.</p>

<p>It was warm and soft, because his mother
had put nice soft hay in it, and wrapped him
all up with a long strip of cloth. They were
in a stable because so many people were in
the city that there was not a bit of room
left. I think it must have been a clean
place, with lots of nice, sweet new hay.</p>

<p>When the shepherds saw the baby they
knew that he was really Jesus their Savior.
They knelt at his feet and worshiped him.
They were so happy that they could hardly
say what they felt. They soon went away
and told the good news to every one they
met. They were very glad because Jesus
had come. He came as a little baby so he
would know how to love and help all other
babies and little children, and be an example<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for them to follow as they grew older.</p>

<p>We are glad Jesus came, and we love to
keep his birthday, because he gives us joy
and peace, fills our hearts with love, and
helps us to be good and happy here and to
get ready to be happy in heaven.</p>

<p>God, our Father in heaven, sent to us
this wonderful Christmas Gift. Think of
the great love he must have for us, to give
us his Son. Think of the great love Jesus
had for us, that he could leave his beautiful
home in heaven to come and help us and
show us how to live. Let us thank him
every day for his great love. “For God so
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son” to be our Savior.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">JOSEPH, and Mary the mother of Jesus,
stayed in Bethlehem for a while. When
Jesus was only eight days old he received
his name; he was called “Jesus,” as the
angel had told Mary.
It was the custom of
the Jews to take their
first son to the temple
and present him to
God, so Joseph and
Mary went to Jerusalem to present Jesus to
God in the temple.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 215px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="215" height="213" alt="holy family and Simeon once more" />
</div>

<p>At the time when Jesus was born, there
was an old man, named Simeon, living in
Jerusalem. He was a good man and was
looking and wishing for Jesus, the promised
Messiah, to come. God’s Holy Spirit had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
told him that he should not die until he
had seen Jesus. Simeon went up to the
temple to worship God every day. One day
while he was in the temple Mary and Joseph
brought the child to present him to God.
When Simeon saw
them he knew that
the infant in Mary’s
arms was his Savior.
He at once took Jesus
in his arms, and with
a heart full of joy he
blessed God and
said, “Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace.” He
had seen the Savior for whom he looked,
and had nothing more to wish; he was perfectly
satisfied to die, now that he had seen
Jesus, the Savior of the world. When
Jesus comes into our hearts we are satisfied,
and not only ready to die, but we are ready
to live and do with glad hearts all that God
wishes us to do. The best way to praise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
God for his wonderful gift is to <i>live for him</i>
and lead others to praise him.</p>

<p>God’s Spirit was upon Simeon, and he rejoiced
to see Jesus his Savior, whom God
had sent to his people. Do you wonder
that Simeon’s heart was full of joy at seeing
God’s greatest gift to man? Should
not we praise him for it?</p>

<p>At the time of Jesus’ birth, the world was
very dark and sinful. People did not know
much about God or what he wanted them
to do. In Jesus, Simeon saw a great Light
which would lighten the world.</p>

</div>
<p>Did you ever try to walk in a dark night
where there were no lights to shine on the
pathway? If so, you were sure to go the
wrong road, or to stumble and fall. While
you were walking in the darkness, did a
great electric light suddenly shine out,
making all light about you? So into the
dark lives of the people Jesus came to be a
Light. We are sure that Jesus is a Light
to us and to all the world. He lived a holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
life, so he made a right path for us to follow.
He showed us how to live and how to
die, so that we may live forever in heaven.
If we take his love into our hearts and do
as he tells us, we shall walk in the light.
Just as a railway locomotive runs in the
great light from the lamp that sends
its bright rays along the track, so Jesus
dwelling in our hearts shines his light just
where we are to travel—that is, he tells us
by his Spirit and by his Word how we are
to act and what we are to do.</p>


<p>While Mary and Joseph
and Jesus were
yet in the temple,
Anna, a prophetess,
came in and saw Jesus.
Then she, too, praised
the Lord because Jesus
had come to be a Light
to the world. She told
the people that Jesus was the Son of God
who had come into this world to live in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hearts and be our Light. Jesus in our
hearts is like a torchlight which we carry
with us always, and which never goes out,
but gives us light wherever we go. We
follow this light when we do the things that
Jesus taught us to do, and when we follow
the example that he left us.</p>

<h2>The Journey of the Wise Men.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE were some very rich, wise men
living away off in another country.
God wanted them to know about his Son.
He did not send angels to tell them; he took
another way. He put a strange new star
in the sky. These wise men spent a great
deal of time studying about stars, so when
they saw this they were very much interested
in it. When they saw strange stars
they thought strange things would happen.
They had heard that the Jews were looking
for Jesus to come and be their king, so they
thought this star must mean that he
had come. They thought very likely that
he had come to Jerusalem, for that was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
great city of the Jews. So they started on
their long journey.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/illus34.jpg" width="247" height="147" alt="wise men on journey" />
</div>

<p>They traveled on until they reached Jerusalem.
Then
they went at once
to Herod the king
and asked him
where Jesus was
who was born
King of the Jews. Herod had not heard
that Jesus was born, and when he heard
this question he was troubled, for he was
not born king—he had been made king.
So he was very much afraid that Jesus, who
was born King, would take his place.</p>


<div class="figright" style="width: 212px;">
<img src="images/illus35a.jpg" width="212" height="203" alt="wise following star" />
</div>

<p>He called in the Jews, who he thought
ought to know, and asked them to find out
where Jesus was to be born. They looked
in the Bible and found that he was to be
born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>When Herod heard this he told the wise
men to go to Bethlehem and look for Jesus,
and when they found him to bring him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
word so that he might go and worship him.
He wanted to kill Jesus, but he did not tell
the wise men so. They again started out,
and they were very much pleased to see the
same star still shining
in the sky.</p>


<p>This star went before
them to guide
them to Bethlehem.
They believed the
star would guide
them right, so they
followed it until it stood over a house in the
city.</p>

<h2>The Wise Men’s Gifts to Jesus.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the wise men went into the
house they found Jesus there with
Mary, his mother, and Joseph, her husband.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 229px;">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="229" height="186" alt="drawing of wise men's visit to house" />
</div>

<p>As soon as they
saw him they knew
it was Jesus, whom
they had come so
far to see. They
fell down before
him and worshiped
him. They
brought him rich gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh. These gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh were costly and useful;
they must have been of great help to Mary
and Joseph, who were very poor. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gifts from the wise men to Jesus showed
their love for him. Those who truly love
Jesus now will be glad to give of their
money to help the poor and needy, and to
teach those who do not know about him;
and what we do for his sake he counts as
done for him. But the greatest gift that
we can give Jesus is the gift of our hearts.</p>

<p>While they were there worshiping Jesus,
God was looking into the heart of Herod,
reading his wicked thoughts. He knew
that if the wise men went back and told
Herod where Jesus was, he would come and
kill him. So when the wise men were ready
to go away, God warned them in a dream to
go back another way and not to go near
Jerusalem, where they would meet Herod.
They believed God in this too, and did as
he told them to.</p>

<h2>The Flight into Egypt.</h2>


<div class="figright" style="width: 225px;">
<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="225" height="179" alt="drawing of journey to Egypt" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the wise men were gone, God sent
an angel to warn Joseph to take Jesus and
Mary, his mother, and leave Bethlehem.
He told him to take them to Egypt and
stay there until he told them they might
return. Why do
you suppose God
told Joseph to leave
their home? He
knew that Herod
wanted to kill
Jesus, and that it
would be dangerous
to stay there. If they went to Egypt
they would be safe, for Herod had no
power over Egypt. They would find friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
there too, for a great many Jews were
living in Egypt then.</p>

<p>Joseph loved God and believed him, so he
proved that he loved and believed him by
obeying at once. He did not wait until
morning, but at once arose, got ready, and
took Mary and Jesus and they started in
the night for Egypt. They did not go to
some other place instead. They went just
when God told them to go, and went just
where he told them to; and they were safe
while they followed God’s directions.</p>

<p>Jesus was soon safe in Egypt. Herod did
not know this, and was still making his
plans to kill him. He was a very wicked,
cruel man. He was wicked enough to kill
two of his own sons, so you see he did not
care much about killing a baby.</p>

<p>He did not know just how old Jesus was,
but thought he could not be over two
years old. He did not know where he lived,
for the wise men did not go back to tell
him. But he was bound to kill Jesus, so he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
told his cruel soldiers to go into every
house in Bethlehem, even into the houses
near Bethlehem, and kill every boy baby
they could find two years old or less.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 181px;">
<img src="images/illus43.jpg" width="181" height="202" alt="drawing of killing of the babies" />
</div>

<p>So they went around killing all the baby
boys. They would go into a house, snatch
the baby out of its crib, or
out of its mother’s arms,
and kill it right before
her eyes. That was a
sad time in Bethlehem;
for many poor mothers
were weeping for
their children. It was
very sad for the mothers,
but the little boys were safe in heaven
with God.</p>

<p>God was still watching over and taking
care of his Son; so when at last Herod was
dead, God again sent an angel to Joseph,
telling him to take Jesus and Mary and go
back to the land of Israel, or the land of
the Jews. So Joseph again set out on a journey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
But he heard that Herod’s son was
king, and he was afraid to go back to Bethlehem,
so he went to Nazareth.</p>

<h2>Jesus in the Temple.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Jesus was a very little baby, his
mother took him to the temple, their
church, and gave him to the Lord. I suppose
they wrote down his name, as we do
our Cradle Roll babies. If they did, I think
we may call Jesus a Cradle Roll baby. I am
sure that Mary and Joseph did all they
could to help the baby to grow up a good,
wise, loving boy. The dear little babies
do not stay babies long; then their toys
go and they want books, for they must
learn a great deal before they are grown-up
men and women. So Jesus’ toys were soon
put away, and he began to study just as
you do. He grew bigger and stronger every
day. At last he was as big as you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
then bigger, until he was as big as your
brother or sister.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<img src="images/illus48.jpg" width="284" height="194" alt="large group of people traveling including boy Jesus" />
</div>

<p>Do you know someone who is twelve
years old? At last Jesus got to be so old.
At that age a boy was no longer a Cradle
Roll baby, nor even a child. Jesus’ mother
said that
now he could
go with her
and Joseph
and their
friends when
they went up
to Jerusalem
to church.
Did you ever go on a journey? How did
you go? On the cars. Were you glad to
go? You got tired, I know. A picture of
Joseph and Mary and Jesus on their way to
Jerusalem would show you that they all
walked. It was a long, hard journey, for
they not only had to walk all the way, but
they had to carry all their bundles. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
went in a company, so they had a nice time
talking with their friends as they walked.
Then when tired or hungry, they would
stop by the way in the shade of some great
rocks—for in that land rocks are found
oftener than shade trees.</p>

<p>You can make a picture of this journey
in your mind. Think of the wall of the
city of Jerusalem and the open gate; inside
the wall is the church, or temple; there is a
road of sand, and on both sides of the road
are a few trees and a good many rocks.</p>

<p>At last they all reached the city, and
slept and rested and ate their food, then
bathed and dressed in their best clothes,
and went to the temple to worship God and
hear about his law out of the Bible.</p>

<p>All this was very wonderful and beautiful
to Jesus. He began to understand that
God was his Father, and that he had some
very great work to do in the world. He
was so interested that when it was time to
start for home he stayed after all the rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
left, and went back to the temple. Perhaps
he had been allowed to go by himself
and did not know they had started home.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 217px;">
<img src="images/illus50.jpg" width="217" height="164" alt="drawing of Jesus in temple" />
</div>

<p>Mary did not miss Jesus for some time.
She thought he was with his young friends
having a good time. At last she became
frightened, for she found that he was not
with any of these friends. Oh, how frightened
she was! Her beautiful boy that she
loved more than her own life, was lost! I
once knew of a very lovely boy who was lost
all night. How his mother cried, and how we
looked for him all night! In the morning
his mother was the
one to find him,
then her sorrow
was changed to joy.</p>

<p>Mary and Joseph
left their friends
and went back to
the city. In her heart Jesus’ mother
knew where to look for him. Can you
think where he was? They found him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the temple talking with the teachers. They
were talking about God’s law. They had
their books, reading and studying together.
These books were made of strips of parchment
or paper fastened at both ends to
round sticks and rolled up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 199px;">
<img src="images/illus51.jpg" width="199" height="128" alt="drawing of Jesus' parents finding him in the temple" />
</div>

<p>When Jesus saw his mother and knew
how she had grieved
about him, he left the
teachers at once and
went back home with
her and Joseph. He
told them that he
knew God was his Father, and that he must
be about his work. But quickly and lovingly
he obeyed his mother and went with
her, even though he longed to stay.</p>

<p>Do you think Jesus was about his heavenly
Father’s business when he obeyed
Mary and Joseph and went home so lovingly
with them? He surely was, for some of
his work that he came to earth to do was to
show children how to treat their parents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
One of the great laws of God is, “Children,
obey your parents.”</p>

<p>Jesus loved to be in the temple, but he
quickly and cheerfully went home with his
mother and Joseph. I think that as he
and his parents were with many of their
dear friends, he was allowed to go around
among them and with them when they went
to the temple, so when his parents left he
perhaps did not really know when his mother
started. Do you think she was careless
to go off and leave him? No, I am sure
she was not; she no doubt thought he was
coming along with his aunts or cousins or
his little friends in the company.</p>

<h2>Jesus in His Home.</h2>


<p class="drop-cap">DO you like cold, dark, stormy days?
How do you feel when you get up and
find the sun shining in your window? You
cannot help feeling good—some of it gets
into your heart and makes you feel happy.
You make us think of sunny days. Sometimes
children are cross, and they make us
think of stormy days. The gloomy,
naughty, selfish child makes everything in
the house seem sad. But how about the
bright, happy, laughing, helpful child?
When he comes into the room, it seems as
if he brought some sunshine in. He is a
sunshiny boy.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/illus56.jpg" width="176" height="216" alt="big crowd of people, Jesus at front" />
</div>
<p>Do you know I am thinking of a boy who
I believe was the sunshiniest one among all
the sunshiny children in the world. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was he? He was Jesus, the dear boy who
was so ready to obey his parents. He
started home with Mary
and Joseph, perhaps
telling Joseph all about
how it happened that he
was left behind them.</p>



<p>After their long, hard
journey, how glad they
were to get home! I am
sure Jesus did all he
could to get everything
ready. First he helped Joseph bring in all
the things they had with them, and Mary
stood at the door of the little house, looking
at the boy she loved so much, and feeling
so glad and thankful that he had not really
been lost.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/illus57.jpg" width="173" height="204" alt="drawing Jesus working in shop with Joseph" />
</div>

<p>Then when they were all settled and
rested and Joseph had to go to his carpenter
work, Jesus would do such little things as
he could to help him, while Mary was doing
her work. Joseph was a carpenter. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
do you think he made? What tools did he
use? Then I think
Jesus must have learned
to use them, too. Perhaps
sometimes Mary
was sick, and then I am
sure he did all he could
to help and comfort her
and make her forget her
pain. He would bring
the jar of fresh water, bathe her head and
give her a cool drink. If your mamma
was sick, what could you do to be a blessing
to her? I knew a little boy who was a
real sunshine boy. When mamma was
sick he would set the table for papa, and
hand mamma a cup of tea, and give her a
smile and a loving kiss. We can all do so
much, and many other things. Think of
some of them. You can pick up your toys
and books and keep them tidy, without
waiting for mamma to talk about it; you
can always run to her with a loving kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
when you wake up and when you go to bed;
you can be very gentle and kind to your little
brothers and sisters; you can try every day
in every way to make sunshine in your
home—to make your home the most beautiful
place in the world. Boys and girls who
do that can make their homes next to
heaven.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 267px;">
<img src="images/illus58.jpg" width="267" height="212" alt="drawing of painting at start of chapter" />
</div>

<p>Jesus did that even when he was very
small. As he
grew older he
grew wiser and
better. He
helped Joseph
more and more
in his shop, and
what he did not
know, Joseph
taught him.</p>

<p>He did not spend all his time in the shop.
He perhaps went to school, for he loved
to study. I think Mary loved to teach a
boy who was so ready to learn. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stand beside her while she read to him.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 247px;">
<img src="images/illus59.jpg" width="247" height="213" alt="Jesus reading scrolls at temple" />
</div>

<p>He liked to play like other boys, but he
always did the
things that other
children should
do, so they would
know just what
was right. That
is why I tell you
so much about
him. Perhaps
children would not know just the right way,
if Jesus had not been a boy and lived with
his mother and loved and obeyed and helped
her.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
